# Zim Tag Autocompletion
Tag autocompletion plugin for Zim Wiki.

After typing `@`, a list of existing tags open up for autocompletion. 

## Release Notes
**NOTE**: Use the bleeding edge release from the master branch, and apply [this fix](https://github.com/zim-desktop-wiki/zim-desktop-wiki/pull/2085) to your Zim Wiki to make this plugin work. Once the Zim PR is merged, we will release a version here.

* v0.95 : Adapted for Python >3.1
* v0.94 : Ported to Zim v0.71 (tested)
* v0.93 : Works with Zim v0.68 and possibly earlier (untested)

## Credits
The plugin is originally developed by [@muguu](https://gist.github.com/muguu) (as shared on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/muguu/1d5910ef05259595fe49cde4c9db9d39#file-tasklist-py)) and later ported to Zim v0.71 by [@shivams](https://github.com/shivams). 

For porting to Zim v0.71, which uses GTK+v3, I took the help of this script which made the job quite easy: [pygi-convert.sh](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pygobject/blob/master/tools/pygi-convert.sh)
